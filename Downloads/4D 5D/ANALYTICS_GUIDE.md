## üé® Chart Types Explained

### When to Use Each Chart

| Chart Type | Best For | Answers Questions Like |
|------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Pie Chart** | Overview & Composition | "What's the breakdown of my model?" |
| **Bar Chart - Count** | Element counting | "Which category has the most elements?" |
| **Bar Chart - Quantities** | Material estimation | "How much concrete do I need?" |
| **Table** | Detailed analysis | "Give me all the numbers" |

## üîç Reading the Data

### Understanding Quantities

**Volume:**
- Measured in cubic units (e.g., m¬≥, ft¬≥)
- Important for: Concrete, excavation, earthwork
- Example: Wall volume = 45.23 m¬≥

**Area:**
- Measured in square units (e.g., m¬≤, ft¬≤)
- Important for: Flooring, painting, cladding
- Example: Floor area = 1250.00 m¬≤

**Length:**
- Measured in linear units (e.g., m, ft)
- Important for: Piping, cables, framing
- Example: Beam length = 156.75 m

**Note:** Units depend on your model's unit settings.

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Run Analytics After Model Changes**
- Always refresh analytics after model updates
- Close and reopen Analytics to recalculate

### 2. **Compare Across Design Iterations**
- Export CSV for each design version
- Track changes in element counts and quantities

### 3. **Use for Clash Detection**
- Unexpected element counts may indicate modeling errors
- Compare with expected quantities from design documents

### 4. **Coordinate with Teams**
- Share CSV exports with quantity surveyors
- Use charts in client presentations
- Include in project documentation

### 5. **Verify Quantities**
- Cross-reference with manual calculations
- Check units (metric vs. imperial)
- Confirm with project specifications

---

## üéØ Use Cases

### For Architects
- **Design Review**: Verify element distribution matches design intent
- **Presentations**: Use charts to explain design composition to clients
- **Documentation**: Export BOQ for project records

### For Engineers
- **Structural Analysis**: Calculate material volumes for load analysis
- **MEP Coordination**: Track piping/duct/cable lengths
- **Quantity Takeoff**: Generate preliminary material estimates

### For Contractors
- **Cost Estimation**: Use quantities for material pricing
- **Procurement**: Determine order quantities from BOQ
- **Project Planning**: Schedule work based on element counts

### For Quantity Surveyors
- **BOQ Preparation**: Extract quantities for detailed BOQ
- **Cost Control**: Monitor quantities against budget
- **Claims Management**: Document as-built quantities

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### No Data Showing

**Problem:** Analytics screen is blank or shows zero elements

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure model is fully loaded (wait for 3D view to appear)
2. Check that model has visible elements
3. Try closing and reopening Analytics
4. Refresh the page and reload the model

---

### Missing Quantities

**Problem:** Volume/Area/Length columns show 0.00

**Solutions:**
1. Not all elements have volume/area/length properties
2. Some categories (like groups/assemblies) don't have quantities
3. Check model properties to verify quantities exist
4. This is normal for annotation elements, views, etc.

---

### Categories Show as "Uncategorized"

**Problem:** Many elements grouped under "Uncategorized"

**Solutions:**
1. Elements may lack Category property in the model
2. This is common in imported models
3. Consider updating model metadata in authoring software
4. Elements are still counted correctly

---

### Export CSV Not Working

**Problem:** CSV file doesn't download

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser download settings
2. Ensure pop-ups are not blocked
3. Try a different browser
4. Check for browser console errors (F12)

---

## üîÑ Refresh Analytics

Analytics data is extracted when you first open the tab. To refresh:

1. **Close Analytics** (click "Close" button)
2. **Make changes** to model view/filters (if needed)
3. **Reopen Analytics** (click "Analytics" button)
4. Data is **automatically recalculated**

---

## üìê Technical Details

### Data Extraction

- Uses `getBulkProperties2()` API for comprehensive property extraction
- Analyzes all leaf nodes (actual elements, not groups)
- Processes properties: Category, Volume, Area, Length
- Handles missing properties gracefully

### Performance

- **Small Models** (< 1000 elements): < 2 seconds
- **Medium Models** (1000-10000 elements): 2-10 seconds
- **Large Models** (> 10000 elements): 10-30 seconds

### Color Scheme

Uses Autodesk brand colors:
- **Hello Yellow** (#FFD700)
- **Autodesk Blue** (#0696D7)
- **Autodesk Teal** (#00C9A7)
- **Autodesk Orange** (#FF6B35)
- Plus additional accent colors for more categories
