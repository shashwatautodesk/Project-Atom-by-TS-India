# 🎬 4D Playback Guide

## Overview

The **4D Playback** feature allows you to visualize your construction schedule over time. Elements appear and disappear based on their scheduled dates, showing you exactly what should be built at any point in the timeline.

---

## ✅ What's Fixed

The 4D playback now properly:

✅ **Shows/hides elements** based on scheduled dates  
✅ **Color-codes visible elements** by status  
✅ **Filters elements** that haven't started yet  
✅ **Isolates** only relevant elements for the current date  
✅ **Updates automatically** when you change the date  
✅ **Respects status filters** (All/Not Started/In Progress/Completed/Delayed)  

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Date-Based Visibility**

**Before Start Date:**
- Element is **HIDDEN** 🚫
- Not yet built

**During Construction (Start → End):**
- Element is **VISIBLE** ✅
- Colored **YELLOW** (In Progress) 🟡
- This is the active construction period

**After End Date:**
- Element is **VISIBLE** ✅
- Colored **GREEN** (Completed) 🟢
- Work is done, element remains

### **Status Colors**

| Status | Color | When Applied |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| ⚪ Gray | Not Started | Element has dates but current date is before start |
| 🟡 Yellow | In Progress | Current date is between start and end dates |
| 🟢 Green | Completed | Current date is after end date (or manually set) |
| 🔴 Red | Delayed | Manually set as delayed in properties |

## 🎮 Using Playback Controls

### **Step 1: Import Schedule**

1. Enable 4D Mode
2. Click "Import Excel"
3. Upload CSV with dates
4. Map columns
5. Import

**Result:** Elements now have schedule data

### **Step 2: Navigate Timeline**

**Date Picker:**
- Select any date to jump to that point in time
- Elements instantly update to show what's visible

**Step Controls:**
- **⏮️ Step Backward** - Go back 7 days
- **⏭️ Step Forward** - Go forward 7 days

**Playback Speed:**
- 0.5x - Slow motion
- 1x - Normal (default)
- 2x - Fast
- 4x - Very fast

### **Step 3: Filter by Status**

**Show Elements dropdown:**

- **All Elements** - Show everything (respecting dates)
- **Not Started** - Only elements not yet begun
- **In Progress** - Only elements being worked on
- **Completed** - Only finished elements
- **Delayed** - Only elements behind schedule

---

## 📋 Example Workflow

### **Visualize Construction Sequence**

**Scenario:** Show foundation → structure → envelope progression

**Steps:**
1. Import schedule with phases
2. Set date to project start (e.g., Oct 1, 2025)
   - See only foundation elements (scheduled for Oct 1-15)
3. Move date to Oct 20
   - Foundation complete (green)
   - Structure now visible (yellow)
4. Move date to Nov 15
   - Foundation complete (green)
   - Structure complete (green)
   - Envelope now visible (yellow)

## 🔍 Debug Console Output

Open F12 console to see detailed logs:

```
=== Applying 4D Visualization ===
Current Date: 2025-10-15
Status Filter: all
Total elements with 4D data: 25
Elements to show: 8
Elements to hide: 17
=== Visualization Applied ===
```

This tells you:
- What date you're viewing
- How many elements have schedule data
- How many are visible vs. hidden

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### **Visibility Logic**

```javascript
if (currentDate < startDate) {
  // HIDE - Not started yet
  isVisible = false
}
else if (currentDate >= startDate && currentDate <= endDate) {
  // SHOW as In Progress
  isVisible = true
  color = YELLOW
}
else if (currentDate > endDate) {
  // SHOW as Completed
  isVisible = true
  color = GREEN
}
```

### **What Gets Hidden**

1. **Elements without schedule data** - Hidden during 4D playback
2. **Elements before start date** - Not yet built
3. **Elements not matching status filter** - Filtered out

### **What Stays Visible**

1. **Elements being worked on** (between start & end dates)
2. **Elements already completed** (after end date)
3. **Elements matching the status filter**

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Tip 1: Use Isolation**

The playback automatically **isolates** visible elements:
- Hides everything else
- Focuses camera on active work
- Cleaner visualization

To see ALL elements again:
- Disable 4D Mode
- Or set filter to "All Elements"

### **Tip 2: Combine with Gantt Chart**

1. Open Gantt Chart
2. Note important dates
3. Close Gantt Chart
4. Use date picker to jump to those dates
5. See 3D visualization of that moment

### **Tip 3: Status Override**

Elements can have different statuses than dates suggest:
- Element might be "Delayed" even during scheduled period
- Element might be "Completed" before end date
- Status from CSV overrides date-based calculation

### **Tip 4: Performance with Large Models**

If model is slow:
1. Import fewer elements at a time
2. Use status filters to show less
3. Group by phase and work on one phase

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Elements don't appear/disappear when changing date**

**Solution:**
1. Check F12 console for errors
2. Verify elements have both Start Date AND End Date
3. Make sure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
4. Try manually clicking an element to verify 4D data is there

### **Issue: All elements are hidden**

**Cause:** Current date is before all start dates

**Solution:**
- Move date forward to your project start date
- Check Gantt Chart to see date range
- Verify schedule dates were imported correctly

### **Issue: Elements stay the wrong color**

**Cause:** Status filter is active

**Solution:**
- Set "Show Elements" to "All Elements"
- Check element's actual status in Property Panel
- Re-import if status is incorrect

### **Issue: Playback is too fast/slow**

**Solution:**
- Use Playback Speed dropdown
- 0.5x for detailed review
- 2x-4x for quick overview

## 🎨 Visual Example

```
Timeline: Oct 1 ────── Oct 15 ────── Oct 30 ────── Nov 15

Foundation:    [████████]
               Green       (Completed by Oct 15)

Structure:               [████████████]
                        Yellow (In progress Oct 15-Nov 15)

Envelope:                            [Hidden]
                                    (Hasn't started yet)
```

**On Oct 1:**
- Foundation: Yellow (in progress)
- Structure: Hidden (not started)
- Envelope: Hidden (not started)

**On Oct 15:**
- Foundation: Green (completed)
- Structure: Yellow (in progress)
- Envelope: Hidden (not started)

**On Nov 15:**
- Foundation: Green (completed)
- Structure: Green (completed)
- Envelope: Yellow (in progress)
